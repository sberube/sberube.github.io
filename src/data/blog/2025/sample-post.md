Here’s some insight for our friend Jeff Goldblum: “Life finds a way.”

This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? I was part of something special. What do they got in there? King Kong? They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking.

So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. You really think you can fly that thing? Life finds a way. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.
