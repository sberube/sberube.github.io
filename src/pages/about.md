I design and evolve resilient cloud systems on Azure with .NET—platforms that ingest, route, and process data reliably at scale. From IoT event streams to actor-model workloads and multi-region failover paths, my focus is building architectures that keep delivering when traffic spikes, regions wobble, or dependencies degrade.

I like getting things right early: clarifying concurrency boundaries, shaping stable contracts, instrumenting telemetry (before the first incident), and baking in graceful failure modes—timeouts, backpressure, idempotency, partitioning. I partner closely with teams as an architect, deep-dive troubleshooter, and steady wingman who quietly removes invisible risk.

Reliability and clarity matter—so does enjoying the craft. The best engineering cultures combine rigor with levity: serious work, relaxed people. That balance produces durable systems and teams that sustain them.

What I build / care about:

- Event-driven & messaging-centric platforms (Azure Service Bus / Kafka patterns)
- Actor & task orchestration workloads
- Multi-tenant isolation & cost-aware scalability
- Observability as a design input (metrics, traces, structured logs)
- OAuth/OIDC flows & boundary authorization
- Resilience engineering (timeouts, retries, circuit isolation)
- Infrastructure as Code (Bicep/Terraform) & deployment safety

If you’re here for practical takes on rate limiting, backpressure, message flow control, or hardening distributed components—start with the featured posts. More deep dives are on the way.

Serious engineering; relaxed people.
